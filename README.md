# Todo

- [X] Structure form class
    - form name
    - get form result
- [ ] build interface to configure forms
    - create machanism to update fields on the create form form.
    - this is needed when the update field is submitted

# Bugs
- [X] update one field updates all fields 
- [ ] When deleting the content of a field that has expression, it triggers the expression to run, filling the field again.
    - Makes impossible to have the field as blank
